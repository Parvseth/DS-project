# Data Science Course Project (DS 203) â€“ IIT Bombay

This is the course project for the Data Science course **DS 203** at **IIT Bombay**.

## Project Description

Using analysis and a machine learning model on **MFCC coefficients of songs**, we predicted the **song's singer (artist name)** with **88% accuracy**.

## Procedure

The following sequence of scripts and notebooks was used for feature preparation:

1. `padding.py`  
2. `feature_making.py`  
3. `labelling.py`  
4. `combining_features.py`  
5. `mergining_final.py`  
6. `processing.ipynb`

## Model Used

- **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)**  
- **Kernel:** RBF (Radial Basis Function)
